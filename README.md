This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that are implemented using the class concept.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for learning and practicing the use of classes in C++. Each program demonstrates various aspects of object-oriented programming (OOP) using classes, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

## Usage

Users can explore the programs to understand how classes are utilized in C++ to model real-world entities, organize code, and improve code reusability. Each program is self-contained and focused on illustrating a specific concept or solving a particular problem using classes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Navneet1206/project-of-class.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired program:

   ```
   cd README.md
   ```

3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler such as g++:

   ```
   g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have a C++ program that demonstrates the use of classes and you'd like to share it with others, feel free to submit a pull request.
